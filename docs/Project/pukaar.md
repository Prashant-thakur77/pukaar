# Pukaar — Volunteer-Report Flow

## 1. Overview

Pukaar is the volunteer-facing half of the Pukaar submission. Its user is a Defensa Civil municipal volunteer in Argentina's Litoral region, today coordinating flood and storm reports over WhatsApp audio messages that pile up in a single chat and are triaged by hand. Pukaar replaces that pipeline with a structured intake: a PWA (or Android app) captures audio, photo, and an optional typed transcript, ships it to a backend that parses it into a `ParsedObservation`, fuses it with the site's camera-derived signals into a `FusedAlert`, and — when the alert is orange or red — lets Pukaar AI emit tool calls that drive local actuators (alarm, radio, push notification). Unlike a WhatsApp thread, every report is timestamped, geo-tagged to a site, machine-parseable, and queueable while offline.

Routing entry point: `backend/src/Pukaar/api/routers/pukaar.py`.

## 3. The `parser_source` field

| Value | Where it's set | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| `"rules"` | `services/report_structuring._fallback_parse` | Deterministic keyword parser. Used when the LLM is unreachable or returns unparseable JSON. Always available. |
| `"llm"` | `services/report_structuring._normalize_llm_payload` | Pukaar AI via Ollama on the backend host (`Pukaar AIFewShotTextStructurer` with the rioplatense few-shot corpus). Default when Ollama is reachable. |
| `"pukaar-ai-android"` | `ui/MainViewModel.submitReport` (Android) | Pukaar AI running on-device via LiteRT-LM Android. Set when `pukaar-model-2b.litertlm` is present in `context.filesDir` and `structureReport` returned valid JSON. No silent fallback to the backend on failure — the operator sees the error and can retry. |

The Android UI surfaces this field as a small chip next to the parsed observation, with Spanish labels chosen so a volunteer in the field can reason about provenance without reading logs:

- `"Analizado con Pukaar AI en este dispositivo"` for `pukaar-ai-android`
- `"Analizado por Pukaar AI en el servidor"` for `llm`
- `"Estructurado por reglas locales"` for `rules`

The chip is informational; it does not gate submission or escalation.

## 4. New environment variables introduced on this branch

| Name | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PUKAAR_FEWSHOT_COUNT` | `12` | Number of rioplatense few-shot examples injected into the structuring prompt. Drop to `4` for CPU-only dev to keep prompt processing under ~90 s. |
| `PUKAAR_ASR_ENABLED` | `true` | Master switch for the Whisper transcription path. Set to `false` to skip ASR entirely (typed transcripts only). |
| `PUKAAR_ASR_MODEL_SIZE` | `"tiny"` | Faster-Whisper model size. `tiny` is int8-quantized, ~75 MB cache, ~3× realtime on CPU. |
| `PUKAAR_ASR_MODEL_CACHE_DIR` | `backend/data/whisper-models` | Local cache directory for the downloaded Whisper weights. |
| `Pukaar_IMAGE_ENABLED` | inherits `PUKAAR_MULTIMODAL_ENABLED` | Separate flag so volunteer-photo assessment can be enabled while node-side multimodal stays off (or vice versa). |
| `PUKAAR_IMAGE_MAX_TOKENS` | `256` | Output token cap for the multimodal image assessor. On CPU-only dev hardware ~75% of latency is vision-encoder prompt processing (768x768 patches); dropping output tokens helps but is not the bottleneck. Use together with `PUKAAR_IMAGE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. |
| `PUKAAR_IMAGE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `300` | HTTP timeout for `image_assessor.assess`. Decoupled from `PUKAAR_LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` so a slow multimodal call does not force the structuring/reasoning pipeline to wait that long. On CPU-only dev with `IMAGE_MAX_TOKENS=120` the assess completes in ~190–220 s, so 300 s gives margin. |
| `PUKAAR_ACTUATORS_ENABLED` | `true` | When `false`, `dispatch_actuators` is short-circuited and no tool calls are issued regardless of alert level. In production with `PUKAAR_NODE_PROVIDER=litert`, actuator selection runs through `LiteRTNodeRuntime`; Ollama remains the explicit development provider when `PUKAAR_NODE_PROVIDER=ollama`. |

## 5. Latency on CPU-only development hardware

Measured during the Pukaar integration branch on CPU-only hardware:

- Pukaar AI E2B: ~3.5 tokens/s sustained.
- ASR (Whisper tiny int8): first-call cold load ~35 s; transcription of a 30 s wav: ~5–10 s.
- Image assessment on a single frame (multimodal Pukaar AI): ~190 s wall-clock (192 s for the USGS demo frame). This is the reason image assessment is wired as a FastAPI `BackgroundTask` and not synchronous inside the POST handler — a synchronous call would push the response well past any reasonable mobile HTTP timeout.
- Full `POST /api/reports` without image, with 4 few-shot examples: ~3 minutes.

Demo machines with GPU acceleration (the production target via MediaPipe on Android, or a Raspberry Pi paired with a hardware accelerator) bring these numbers into seconds. The CPU-only figures above are the floor, not the target.

## 6. Known gaps and out-of-scope items

- Native photo and audio capture inside the Android UI is NOT implemented in this PR. The device-capture path requires CameraX plus `MediaRecorder` wiring and was deferred because no physical device or emulator was available in this session. The PWA covers the demo path; Android currently exercises the on-device structuring layer against typed transcripts.
- The `.litertlm` asset (`pukaar-model-2b.litertlm` for LiteRT-LM, ~1.4 GB) is NOT bundled in the APK and is NOT auto-downloaded. The `Pukaar AIOnDevice` wrapper expects it at `context.filesDir/pukaar-model-2b.litertlm`; the dev or operator places it there manually (see [`docs/Project/android_pukaar-ai.md`](android_pukaar-ai.md) "Build & run" for the adb-push flow). MediaPipe `.task` was the original plan but Google has not shipped a Pukaar AI `.task` file, so the Android tier moved to LiteRT-LM — same artifact the backend uses.
- Android unit tests under `app/src/test/` are written but require an Android
  SDK. Run `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest` in an Android-capable checkout.
- Real-device benchmarks for on-device Pukaar AI latency are pending. The numbers in `docs/Project/android_pukaar-ai.md` are still projections.
- iOS Safari `MediaRecorder` has well-known quirks; the PWA targets Chrome-class browsers for the Project demo. This belongs in the pitch script.
- Production actuator dispatch no longer depends on Ollama when `PUKAAR_NODE_PROVIDER=litert`. The current LiteRT path uses strict JSON structured tool selection (`tool_calls`) through `LiteRTNodeRuntime`, not native LiteRT function calling. Unknown tools or malformed JSON make `dispatch_actuators` return `[]`; in the integrated `decision_engine` path, model-selected tools are constrained to deterministic recommended pending actuators for the alert level, and orange/red alerts then use deterministic fallback for any missing recommended actuators. The fallback can be total or partial without refiring tools already selected by LiteRT.
- Raspberry Pi 5 8GB smoke with real `LiteRTNodeRuntime` did not confirm parseable actuator JSON yet: two direct `dispatch_actuators`/selection runs with E2B text GPU were killed by external timeouts at 420 s and 300 s before emitting a normal response. This is a LiteRT structured-selection latency limitation to keep visible; it does not block orange/red actuation continuity because the decision engine records and fires missing deterministic recommended actuators when model selection is empty or incomplete.
- `frontend/src/pages/Calibration.tsx` has a pre-existing lint error (`react-hooks/immutability`: `draw` referenced before declaration). This bug is from commit `ce62b88` (P5 calibration UI, pre-Pukaar branch). It is not introduced by this PR and is left for a separate fix so the diff stays focused on Pukaar.

## 7. How to reproduce the demo flow

1. From the repo root: `./scripts/dev.sh` (starts Ollama, backend, and the PWA frontend; this is the existing entry point — no new launcher).
2. With Ollama warm, smoke-test the endpoint directly:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/reports \
     -F "transcript_text=Hay agua sobre la calle y sigue subiendo" \
     -F "reporter_name=Demo" \
     -F "reporter_role=volunteer" \
     -F "offline_created=false" \
     -F "photo=@fixtures/frames/silverado_060s.jpg" \
     -F "audio=@/path/to/any_30s.wav"
   ```

   Any 30 s wav works for `audio`; the photo path above is the USGS demo frame already in the repo.
3. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`, navigate to Report, record voice, attach a photo, and submit through the PWA.
4. Observe: backend log shows `local alarm triggered ...`, the response carries alert level red, and `decision_trace` contains both `actuated: trigger_alarm, notify_app` (or similar, depending on what Pukaar AI chose) AND eventually `image_description: ...` once the background task finishes.
